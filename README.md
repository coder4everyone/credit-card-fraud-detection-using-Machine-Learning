# credit-card-fraud-detection-using-Machine-Learning
In this project, we used logistic regression to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We achieved a high accuracy on both the training and testing data, indicating that the model is effective at detecting fraudulent transactions. The Streamlit application provides an easy-to-use interface for detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time.
